       "'11.0.3 (April 3, 2019; 3 months ago (2019-04-03) ) [±] Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets, which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages. It\\'s still possible to run Java in web browsers after most of them having dropped support for Java\\'s VM. Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. In addition, several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM, including Clojure, Groovy, and Scala. Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective-C. Java eschews certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap (while some implementations e.g. all currently supported by Oracle, may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead) and all variables of object types are references. Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM. On November 13, 2006, Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The latest versions are Java 12, released in March 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version (\"Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support\"), released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the \"legacy\" Java 8 LTS the last free \"public update\" in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) \"highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java\", because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9 (and 10) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to \"immediately transition\" to Java 11 (Java 12 is also an non-LTS option). Oracle released the last public update for the legacy Java 8 LTS, which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Java 8 will be supported with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle and others \"highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java\" because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December 2018. The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming language. A Java platform will include an execution engine (called a virtual machine), a compiler and a set of libraries; there may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements. Java is not specific to any processor or operating system as Java platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems with a view to enable Java programs to run identically on all of them. Different platforms target different classes of device and application domains: The Java platform consists of several programs, each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities. For example, the Java compiler, which converts Java source code into Java bytecode (an intermediate language for the JVM), is provided as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), complementing the JVM with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, converts intermediate bytecode into native machine code on the fly. The Java platform also includes an extensive set of libraries. The essential components in the platform are the Java language compiler, the libraries, and the runtime environment in which Java intermediate bytecode executes according to the rules laid out in the virtual machine specification. The heart of the Java platform is the concept of a \"virtual machine\" that executes Java bytecode programs. This bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running under. However, new versions, such as for Java 10 (and earlier), have made small changes, meaning the bytecode is in general only forward compatible. There is a JIT (Just In Time) compiler within the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. The JIT compiler translates the Java bytecode into native processor instructions at run-time and caches the native code in memory during execution. The use of bytecode as an intermediate language permits Java programs to run on any platform that has a virtual machine available. The use of a JIT compiler means that Java applications, after a short delay during loading and once they have \"warmed up\" by being all or mostly JIT-compiled, tend to run about as fast as native programs. Since JRE version 1.2, Sun\\'s JVM implementation has included a just-in-time compiler instead of an interpreter. Although Java programs are cross-platform or platform independent, the code of the Java Virtual Machines (JVM) that execute these programs is not. Every supported operating platform has its own JVM. In most modern operating systems (OSs), a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer\\'s job. This code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime. Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the pre-existing OS libraries. Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing many of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems. Most of the system library is also written in Java. For instance, the Swing library paints the user interface and handles the events itself, eliminating many subtle differences between how different platforms handle components. The Java class libraries serve three purposes within the Java platform. First, like other standard code libraries, the Java libraries provide the programmer a well-known set of functions to perform common tasks, such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing. Second, the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system. Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily intertwined with the distinctive implementations of each platform. The java.net and java.io libraries implement an abstraction layer in native OS code, then provide a standard interface for the Java applications to perform those tasks. Finally, when some underlying platform does not support all of the features a Java application expects, the class libraries work to gracefully handle the absent components, either by emulation to provide a substitute, or at least by providing a consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature. The word \"Java\", alone, usually refers to Java programming language that was designed for use with the Java platform. Programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase \"platform\", although the Java programming language was listed as a core part of the Java platform before Java 7. The language and runtime were therefore commonly considered a single unit. However, an effort was made with the Java 7 specification to more clearly treat the Java language and the Java virtual machine as separate entities, so that they are no longer considered a single unit. Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM. Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the Java language. These include: The success of Java and its write once, run anywhere concept has led to other similar efforts, notably the .NET Framework, appearing since 2002, which incorporates many of the successful aspects of Java. .NET in its complete form (Microsoft\\'s implementation) is currently only fully available on Windows platforms, whereas Java is fully available on many platforms. .NET was built from the ground-up to support multiple programming languages, while the Java platform was initially built to support only the Java language, although many other languages have been made for JVM since. .NET includes a Java-like language called Visual J# (formerly named J++) that is incompatible with the Java specification, and the associated class library mostly dates to the old JDK 1.1 version of the language. For these reasons, it is more of a transitional language to switch from Java to the .NET platform than it is a first class .NET language. Visual J# was discontinued with the release of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. The existing version shipping with Visual Studio 2005 will be supported until 2015 as per the product life-cycle strategy.[citation needed] The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a Sun product aimed at Java developers. Since the introduction of Java, it has been by far the most widely used Java software development kit (SDK).[citation needed] It contains a Java compiler, a full copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and many other important development tools. The Java platform and language began as an internal project at Sun Microsystems in December 1990, providing an alternative to the C++/C programming languages. Engineer Patrick Naughton had become increasingly frustrated with the state of Sun\\'s C++ and C application programming interfaces (APIs) and tools, as well as with the way the NeWS project was handled by the organization. Naughton informed Scott McNealy about his plan of leaving Sun and moving to NeXT; McNealy asked him to pretend he was God and send him an e-mail explaining how to fix the company. Naughton envisioned the creation of a small team that could work autonomously without the bureaucracy that was stalling other Sun projects. McNealy forwarded the message to other important people at Sun, and the Stealth Project started. The Stealth Project was soon renamed to the Green Project, with James Gosling and Mike Sheridan joining Naughton. Together with other engineers, they began work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California. They aimed to develop new technology for programming next-generation smart appliances, which Sun expected to offer major new opportunities. The team originally considered using C++, but rejected it for several reasons. Because they were developing an embedded system with limited resources, they decided that C++ needed too much memory and that its complexity led to developer errors. The language\\'s lack of garbage collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system memory, a challenging and error-prone task. The team also worried about the C++ language\\'s lack of portable facilities for security, distributed programming, and threading. Finally, they wanted a platform that would port easily to all types of devices. Bill Joy had envisioned a new language combining Mesa and C. In a paper called Further, he proposed to Sun that its engineers should produce an object-oriented environment based on C++. Initially, Gosling attempted to modify and extend C++ (a proposed development that he referred to as \"C++ ++ --\") but soon abandoned that in favor of creating a new language, which he called Oak, after the tree that stood just outside his office. By the summer of 1992, the team could demonstrate portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a personal digital assistant (PDA) device named Star7 that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called \"Duke\" to assist the user. In November of that year, the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California. The Firstperson team had an interest in building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun. In June and July 1994 – after three days of brainstorming with John Gage (the Director of Science for Sun), Gosling, Joy, Naughton, Wayne Rosing, and Eric Schmidt – the team re-targeted the platform for the World Wide Web. They felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like Mosaic the Internet could evolve into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV. As a prototype, Naughton wrote a small browser, WebRunner (named after the movie Blade Runner), renamed HotJava in 1995. In 1994, Sun renamed the Oak language to Java after a trademark search revealed that Oak Technology used the name Oak. Although Java 1.0a became available for download in 1994, the first public release of Java, Java 1.0a2 with the HotJava browser, came on May 23, 1995, announced by Gage at the SunWorld conference. Accompanying Gage\\'s announcement, Marc Andreessen, Executive Vice President of Netscape Communications Corporation, unexpectedly announced that Netscape browsers would include Java support. On January 9, 1996, Sun Microsystems formed the JavaSoft group to develop the technology. While the so-called Java applets for web browsers no longer are the most popular use of Java (with it e.g. more used server-side) or the most popular way to run code client-side (JavaScript took over as more popular), it still is possible to run Java (or other JVM-languages such as Kotlin) in web browsers, even after JVM-support has been dropped from them, using e.g. TeaVM. The Java language has undergone several changes since the release of JDK (Java Development Kit) 1.0 on January 23, 1996, as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4 the Java Community Process (JCP) has governed the evolution of the Java Language. The JCP uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The Java Language Specification (JLS) specifies the language; changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. Sun released JDK 1.1 on February 19, 1997. Major additions included an extensive retooling of the AWT event model, inner classes added to the language, JavaBeans and JDBC. J2SE 1.2 (December 8, 1998) – Codename Playground. This and subsequent releases through J2SE 5.0 were rebranded Java 2 and the version name \"J2SE\" (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition) replaced JDK to distinguish the base platform from J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition). Major additions included reflection, a collections framework, Java IDL (an interface description language implementation for CORBA interoperability), and the integration of the Swing graphical API into the core classes. A Java Plug-in was released, and Sun\\'s JVM was equipped with a JIT compiler for the first time. J2SE 1.3 (May 8, 2000) – Codename Kestrel. Notable changes included the bundling of the HotSpot JVM (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April, 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM), JavaSound, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA). J2SE 1.4 (February 6, 2002) – Codename Merlin. This became the first release of the Java platform developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 59. Major changes included regular expressions modeled after Perl, exception chaining, an integrated XML parser and XSLT processor (JAXP), and Java Web Start. J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004) – Codename Tiger. It was originally numbered 1.5, which is still used as the internal version number. Developed under JSR 176, Tiger added several significant new language features including the for-each loop, generics, autoboxing and var-args. Java SE 6 (December 11, 2006) – Codename Mustang. It was bundled with a database manager and facilitates the use of scripting languages with the JVM (such as JavaScript using Mozilla\\'s Rhino engine). As of this version, Sun replaced the name \"J2SE\" with Java SE and dropped the \".0\" from the version number. Other major changes include support for pluggable annotations (JSR 269), many GUI improvements, including native UI enhancements to support the look and feel of Windows Vista, and improvements to the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) & JVM Tool Interface for better monitoring and troubleshooting. Java SE 7 (July 28, 2011) – Codename Dolphin. This version developed under JSR 336. It added many small language changes including strings in switch, try-with-resources and type inference for generic instance creation. The JVM was extended with support for dynamic languages, while the class library was extended among others with a join/fork framework, an improved new file I/O library and support for new network protocols such as SCTP. Java 7 Update 76 was released in January 2015, with expiration date April 14, 2015. In June 2016, after the last public update of Java 7, \"remotely exploitable\" security bugs in Java 6, 7, and 8 were announced. Java SE 8 (March 18, 2014) – Notable changes include language-level support for lambda expressions (closures) and default methods, the Project Nashorn JavaScript runtime, a new Date and Time API inspired by Joda Time, and the removal of PermGen. This version is not officially supported on the Windows XP platform. However, due to the end of Java 7\\'s lifecycle it is the recommended version for XP users. Previously, only an unofficial manual installation method had been described for Windows XP SP3. It refers to JDK8, the developing platform for Java that also includes a fully functioning Java Runtime Environment. Java 8 is supported on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Vista SP2 and Windows 7 SP1, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and higher (and some other OSes). Java SE 9 and 10 had higher system requirements, i.e. Windows 7 or Server 2012 (and web browser minimum certified is upped to Internet Explorer 11 or other web browsers), and Oracle dropped 32-bit compatibility for all platforms, i.e. only Oracle\\'s \"64-bit Java virtual machines (JVMs) are certified\". Java SE 11 was released September 2018, the first LTS release since the rapid release model was adopted starting with version 9. For the first time, OpenJDK 11 represents the complete source code for the Java platform under the GNU General Public License, and while Oracle still dual-licenses it with an optional proprietary license, there are no code differences nor modules unique to the proprietary-licensed version. Java 11 features include two new garbage collector implementations, Flight Recorder to debug deep issues, a new HTTP client including WebSocket support. Java SE 12 was released March 2019. In addition to language changes, significant changes have been made to the Java class library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5.0. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java 2D, have evolved, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated. According to Oracle in 2010, the Java Runtime Environment was found on over 850 million PCs. Microsoft has not bundled a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with its operating systems since Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft for adding Windows-specific classes to the bundled Java runtime environment, and for making the new classes available through Visual J++.[citation needed] Apple no longer includes a Java runtime with OS X as of version 10.7, but the system prompts the user to download and install it the first time an application requiring the JRE is launched.[citation needed] Many Linux distributions include the OpenJDK runtime as the default virtual machine, negating the need to download the proprietary Oracle JRE. Some Java applications are in fairly widespread desktop use, including the NetBeans and Eclipse integrated development environments, and file sharing clients such as LimeWire and Vuze. Java is also used in the MATLAB mathematics programming environment, both for rendering the user interface and as part of the core system. Java provides cross platform user interface for some high end collaborative applications such as Lotus Notes. Oracle plans to first deprecate the separately installable Java browser plugin from the Java Runtime Environment in JDK 9 then remove it completely from a future release, forcing web developers to use an alternative technology. Java ME has become popular in mobile devices, where it competes with Symbian, BREW, and the .NET Compact Framework. The diversity of mobile phone manufacturers has led to a need for new unified standards so programs can run on phones from different suppliers – MIDP. The first standard was MIDP 1, which assumed a small screen size, no access to audio, and a 32 KB program limit. The more recent MIDP 2 allows access to audio, and up to 64 KB for the program size. With handset designs improving more rapidly than the standards, some manufacturers relax some limitations in the standards, for example, maximum program size. Google\\'s Android operating system uses the Java language, but not its class libraries, therefore the Android platform cannot be called Java. Android, in all supported versions, executes the code on the ART VM (formerly the Dalvik VM up to Android 4.4.4) instead of the Java VM. The Java platform has become a mainstay of enterprise IT development since the introduction of the Enterprise Edition in 1998, in two different ways: Enterprise use of Java has also long been the main driver of open source interest in the platform. Open source communities have produced a large amount of software, including simple function libraries, development frameworks, and open source implementations of standards and tools. Duke is Java\\'s mascot. When Sun announced that Java SE and Java ME would be released under a free software license (the GNU General Public License), they released the Duke graphics under the free BSD license at the same time. A new Duke personality is created every year. For example, in July 2011 \"Future Tech Duke\" included a bigger nose, a jetpack, and blue wings. The source code for Sun\\'s implementations of Java (i.e. the de facto reference implementation) has been available for some time, but until recently,[when?] the license terms severely restricted what could be done with it without signing (and generally paying for) a contract with Sun. As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software, and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform. While several third-party projects (e.g. GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony) created free software partial Java implementations, the large size of the Sun libraries combined with the use of clean room methods meant that their implementations of the Java libraries (the compiler and VM are comparatively small and well defined) were incomplete and not fully compatible. These implementations also tended to be far less optimized than Sun\\'s.[citation needed] Sun announced in JavaOne 2006 that Java would become free and open source software, and on October 25, 2006, at the Oracle OpenWorld conference, Jonathan I. Schwartz said that the company was set to announce the release of the core Java Platform as free and open source software within 30 to 60 days. Sun released the Java HotSpot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the GNU General Public License on November 13, 2006, with a promise that the rest of the JDK (that includes the JRE) would be placed under the GPL by March 2007 (\"except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in distributable source form under the GPL\"). According to Richard Stallman, this would mean an end to the \"Java trap\". Mark Shuttleworth called the initial press announcement, \"A real milestone for the free software community\". Sun released the source code of the Class library under GPL on May 8, 2007, except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from third parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software and open-source license. Some of the encumbered parts turned out to be fairly key parts of the platform such as font rendering and 2D rasterising, but these were released as open-source later by Sun (see OpenJDK Class library). Sun\\'s goal was to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed-source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source. In the meantime, a third-party project called IcedTea created a completely free and highly usable JDK by replacing encumbered code with either stubs or code from GNU Classpath. However OpenJDK has since become buildable without the encumbered parts (from OpenJDK 6 b10 ) and has become the default runtime environment for most Linux distributions. In June 2008, it was announced that IcedTea6 (as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora 9) has passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java 6 implementation. Because OpenJDK is under the GPL, it is possible to redistribute a custom version of the JRE directly with software applications, rather than requiring the enduser (or their sysadmin) to download and install the correct version of the proprietary Oracle JRE onto each of their systems themselves. In most cases, Java support is unnecessary in Web browsers, and security experts recommend that it not be run in a browser unless absolutely necessary. It was suggested that, if Java is required by a few Web sites, users should have a separate browser installation specifically for those sites. When generics were added to Java 5.0, there was already a large framework of classes (many of which were already deprecated), so generics were chosen to be implemented using erasure to allow for migration compatibility and re-use of these existing classes. This limited the features that could be provided by this addition as compared to some other languages. The addition of type wildcards made Java unsound. Java lacks native unsigned integer types. Unsigned data are often generated from programs written in C and the lack of these types prevents direct data interchange between C and Java. Unsigned large numbers are also used in many numeric processing fields, including cryptography, which can make Java less convenient to use for these tasks. Although it is possible to partially circumvent this problem with conversion code and using larger data types, it makes using Java cumbersome for handling the unsigned data. While a 32-bit signed integer may be used to hold a 16-bit unsigned value with relative ease, a 32-bit unsigned value would require a 64-bit signed integer. Additionally, a 64-bit unsigned value cannot be stored using any integer type in Java because no type larger than 64 bits exists in the Java language. If abstracted using functions, function calls become necessary for many operations which are native to some other languages. Alternatively, it is possible to use Java\\'s signed integers to emulate unsigned integers of the same size, but this requires detailed knowledge of complex bitwise operations. While Java\\'s floating point arithmetic is largely based on IEEE 754 (Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic), certain features are not supported even when using the strictfp modifier, such as Exception Flags and Directed Roundings – capabilities mandated by IEEE Standard 754. Additionally, the extended precision floating-point types permitted in 754 and present in many processors are not permitted in Java. In the early days of Java (before the HotSpot VM was implemented in Java 1.3 in 2000) there were some criticisms of performance. However, benchmarks typically report Java as being about 50% slower than C (a language which compiles to native code). Java\\'s performance has improved substantially since the early versions. Performance of JIT compilers relative to native compilers has in some optimized tests been shown to be quite similar. Java bytecode can either be interpreted at run time by a virtual machine, or it can be compiled at load time or runtime into native code which runs directly on the computer\\'s hardware. Interpretation is slower than native execution, and compilation at load time or runtime has an initial performance penalty for the compilation. Modern performant JVM implementations all use the compilation approach, so after the initial startup time the performance is equivalent to native code. The Java platform provides a security architecture which is designed to allow the user to run untrusted bytecode in a \"sandboxed\" manner to protect against malicious or poorly written software. This \"sandboxing\" feature is intended to protect the user by restricting access to certain platform features and APIs which could be exploited by malware, such as accessing the local filesystem, running arbitrary commands, or accessing communication networks. In recent years, researchers have discovered numerous security flaws in some widely used Java implementations, including Oracle\\'s, which allow untrusted code to bypass the sandboxing mechanism, exposing users to malicious attacks. These flaws affect only Java applications which execute arbitrary untrusted bytecode, such as web browser plug-ins that run Java applets downloaded from public websites. Applications where the user trusts, and has full control over, all code that is being executed are unaffected. On August 31, 2012, Java 6 and 7 (both supported back then) on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux were found to have a serious security flaw that allowed a remote exploit to take place by simply loading a malicious web page. Java 5 was later found to be flawed as well. On January 10, 2013, three computer specialists spoke out against Java, telling Reuters that it was not secure and that people should disable Java. Jaime Blasco, Labs Manager with AlienVault Labs, stated that \"Java is a mess. It’s not secure. You have to disable it.\" This vulnerability affects Java 7 and it is unclear if it affects Java 6, so it is suggested that consumers disable it. Security alerts from Oracle announce schedules of critical security-related patches to Java. On January 14, 2013, security experts said that the update still failed to protect PCs from attack.

       "' April months ago Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross platform computing environment Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers Java applets which are less common than standalone Java applications were commonly run in secure sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages It s still possible to run Java in web browsers after most of them having dropped support for Java s VM Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine JVM byte code compilers are also available for other languages including Ada JavaScript Python and Ruby In addition several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM including Clojure Groovy and Scala Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C but object oriented features are modeled after Smalltalk and Objective C Java eschews certain low level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple memory model where objects are allocated on the heap while some implementations e g all currently supported by Oracle may use escape analysis optimization to allocating on the stack instead and all variables of object types are references Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection performed by the JVM On November Sun Microsystems made the bulk of its implementation of Java available under the GNU General Public License GPL The latest versions are Java released in March and Java a currently supported long term support LTS version Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support released on September Oracle released for the legacy Java LTS the last free public update in January for commercial use while it will otherwise still support Java with public updates for personal use up to at least December Oracle and others highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues Since Java and is no longer supported Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to Java Java is also an non LTS option Oracle released the last public update for the legacy Java LTS which is free for commercial use in January Java will be supported with public updates for personal use up to at least December Oracle and others highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues Oracle extended support for Java ended in December The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming language A Java platform will include an execution engine called a virtual machine a compiler and a set of libraries there may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements Java is not specific to any processor or operating system as Java platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems with a view to enable Java programs to run identically on all of them Different platforms target different classes of device and application domains The Java platform consists of several programs each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities For example the Java compiler which converts Java source code into Java bytecode an intermediate language for the JVM is provided as part of the Java Development Kit JDK The Java Runtime Environment JRE complementing the JVM with a just in time JIT compiler converts intermediate bytecode into native machine code on the fly The Java platform also includes an extensive set of libraries The essential components in the platform are the Java language compiler the libraries and the runtime environment in which Java intermediate bytecode executes according to the rules laid out in the virtual machine specification The heart of the Java platform is the concept of a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode programs This bytecode is the same no matter what hardware or operating system the program is running under However new versions such as for Java and earlier have made small changes meaning the bytecode is in general only forward compatible There is a JIT Just In Time compiler within the Java Virtual Machine or JVM The JIT compiler translates the Java bytecode into native processor instructions at run time and caches the native code in memory during execution The use of bytecode as an intermediate language permits Java programs to run on any platform that has a virtual machine available The use of a JIT compiler means that Java applications after a short delay during loading and once they have warmed up by being all or mostly JIT compiled tend to run about as fast as native programs Since JRE version Sun s JVM implementation has included a just in time compiler instead of an interpreter Although Java programs are cross platform or platform independent the code of the Java Virtual Machines JVM that execute these programs is not Every supported operating platform has its own JVM In most modern operating systems OSs a large body of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer s job This code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system applications cannot rely on any of the pre existing OS libraries Instead the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing many of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems Most of the system library is also written in Java For instance the Swing library paints the user interface and handles the events itself eliminating many subtle differences between how different platforms handle components The Java class libraries serve three purposes within the Java platform First like other standard code libraries the Java libraries provide the programmer a well known set of functions to perform common tasks such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing Second the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily intertwined with the distinctive implementations of each platform The java net and java io libraries implement an abstraction layer in native OS code then provide a standard interface for the Java applications to perform those tasks Finally when some underlying platform does not support all of the features a Java application expects the class libraries work to gracefully handle the absent components either by emulation to provide a substitute or at least by providing a consistent way to check for the presence of a specific feature The word Java alone usually refers to Java programming language that was designed for use with the Java platform Programming languages are typically outside of the scope of the phrase platform although the Java programming language was listed as a core part of the Java platform before Java The language and runtime were therefore commonly considered a single unit However an effort was made with the Java specification to more clearly treat the Java language and the Java virtual machine as separate entities so that they are no longer considered a single unit Third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the JVM Some of these are for existing languages while others are for extensions to the Java language These include The success of Java and its write once run anywhere concept has led to other similar efforts notably the NET Framework appearing since which incorporates many of the successful aspects of Java NET in its complete form Microsoft s implementation is currently only fully available on Windows platforms whereas Java is fully available on many platforms NET was built from the ground up to support multiple programming languages while the Java platform was initially built to support only the Java language although many other languages have been made for JVM since NET includes a Java like language called Visual J formerly named J that is incompatible with the Java specification and the associated class library mostly dates to the old JDK version of the language For these reasons it is more of a transitional language to switch from Java to the NET platform than it is a first class NET language Visual J was discontinued with the release of Microsoft Visual Studio The existing version shipping with Visual Studio will be supported until as per the product life cycle strategy citation needed The Java Development Kit JDK is a Sun product aimed at Java developers Since the introduction of Java it has been by far the most widely used Java software development kit SDK citation needed It contains a Java compiler a full copy of the Java Runtime Environment JRE and many other important development tools The Java platform and language began as an internal project at Sun Microsystems in December providing an alternative to the C C programming languages Engineer Patrick Naughton had become increasingly frustrated with the state of Sun s C and C application programming interfaces APIs and tools as well as with the way the NeWS project was handled by the organization Naughton informed Scott McNealy about his plan of leaving Sun and moving to NeXT McNealy asked him to pretend he was God and send him an e mail explaining how to fix the company Naughton envisioned the creation of a small team that could work autonomously without the bureaucracy that was stalling other Sun projects McNealy forwarded the message to other important people at Sun and the Stealth Project started The Stealth Project was soon renamed to the Green Project with James Gosling and Mike Sheridan joining Naughton Together with other engineers they began work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park California They aimed to develop new technology for programming next generation smart appliances which Sun expected to offer major new opportunities The team originally considered using C but rejected it for several reasons Because they were developing an embedded system with limited resources they decided that C needed too much memory and that its complexity led to developer errors The language s lack of garbage collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system memory a challenging and error prone task The team also worried about the C language s lack of portable facilities for security distributed programming and threading Finally they wanted a platform that would port easily to all types of devices Bill Joy had envisioned a new language combining Mesa and C In a paper called Further he proposed to Sun that its engineers should produce an object oriented environment based on C Initially Gosling attempted to modify and extend C a proposed development that he referred to as C but soon abandoned that in favor of creating a new language which he called Oak after the tree that stood just outside his office By the summer of the team could demonstrate portions of the new platform including the Green OS the Oak language the libraries and the hardware Their first demonstration on September focused on building a personal digital assistant PDA device named Star that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called Duke to assist the user In November of that year the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems and the team relocated to Palo Alto California The Firstperson team had an interest in building highly interactive devices and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal RFP for a set top box Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set top box platform However the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI An additional deal with The DO Company for a set top box also failed to materialize Unable to generate interest within the television industry the company was rolled back into Sun In June and July after three days of brainstorming with John Gage the Director of Science for Sun Gosling Joy Naughton Wayne Rosing and Eric Schmidt the team re targeted the platform for the World Wide Web They felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like Mosaic the Internet could evolve into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV As a prototype Naughton wrote a small browser WebRunner named after the movie Blade Runner renamed HotJava in In Sun renamed the Oak language to Java after a trademark search revealed that Oak Technology used the name Oak Although Java a became available for download in the first public release of Java Java a with the HotJava browser came on May announced by Gage at the SunWorld conference Accompanying Gage s announcement Marc Andreessen Executive Vice President of Netscape Communications Corporation unexpectedly announced that Netscape browsers would include Java support On January Sun Microsystems formed the JavaSoft group to develop the technology While the so called Java applets for web browsers no longer are the most popular use of Java with it e g more used server side or the most popular way to run code client side JavaScript took over as more popular it still is possible to run Java or other JVM languages such as Kotlin in web browsers even after JVM support has been dropped from them using e g TeaVM The Java language has undergone several changes since the release of JDK Java Development Kit on January as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library Since J SE the Java Community Process JCP has governed the evolution of the Java Language The JCP uses Java Specification Requests JSRs to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform The Java Language Specification JLS specifies the language changes to the JLS are managed under JSR Sun released JDK on February Major additions included an extensive retooling of the AWT event model inner classes added to the language JavaBeans and JDBC J SE December Codename Playground This and subsequent releases through J SE were rebranded Java and the version name J SE Java Platform Standard Edition replaced JDK to distinguish the base platform from J EE Java Platform Enterprise Edition and J ME Java Platform Micro Edition Major additions included reflection a collections framework Java IDL an interface description language implementation for CORBA interoperability and the integration of the Swing graphical API into the core classes A Java Plug in was released and Sun s JVM was equipped with a JIT compiler for the first time J SE May Codename Kestrel Notable changes included the bundling of the HotSpot JVM the HotSpot JVM was first released in April for the J SE JVM JavaSound Java Naming and Directory Interface JNDI and Java Platform Debugger Architecture JPDA J SE February Codename Merlin This became the first release of the Java platform developed under the Java Community Process as JSR Major changes included regular expressions modeled after Perl exception chaining an integrated XML parser and XSLT processor JAXP and Java Web Start J SE September Codename Tiger It was originally numbered which is still used as the internal version number Developed under JSR Tiger added several significant new language features including the for each loop generics autoboxing and var args Java SE December Codename Mustang It was bundled with a database manager and facilitates the use of scripting languages with the JVM such as JavaScript using Mozilla s Rhino engine As of this version Sun replaced the name J SE with Java SE and dropped the from the version number Other major changes include support for pluggable annotations JSR many GUI improvements including native UI enhancements to support the look and feel of Windows Vista and improvements to the Java Platform Debugger Architecture JPDA JVM Tool Interface for better monitoring and troubleshooting Java SE July Codename Dolphin This version developed under JSR It added many small language changes including strings in switch try with resources and type inference for generic instance creation The JVM was extended with support for dynamic languages while the class library was extended among others with a join fork framework an improved new file I O library and support for new network protocols such as SCTP Java Update was released in January with expiration date April In June after the last public update of Java remotely exploitable security bugs in Java and were announced Java SE March Notable changes include language level support for lambda expressions closures and default methods the Project Nashorn JavaScript runtime a new Date and Time API inspired by Joda Time and the removal of PermGen This version is not officially supported on the Windows XP platform However due to the end of Java s lifecycle it is the recommended version for XP users Previously only an unofficial manual installation method had been described for Windows XP SP It refers to JDK the developing platform for Java that also includes a fully functioning Java Runtime Environment Java is supported on Windows Server R SP Windows Vista SP and Windows SP Ubuntu LTS and higher and some other OSes Java SE and had higher system requirements i e Windows or Server and web browser minimum certified is upped to Internet Explorer or other web browsers and Oracle dropped bit compatibility for all platforms i e only Oracle s bit Java virtual machines JVMs are certified Java SE was released September the first LTS release since the rapid release model was adopted starting with version For the first time OpenJDK represents the complete source code for the Java platform under the GNU General Public License and while Oracle still dual licenses it with an optional proprietary license there are no code differences nor modules unique to the proprietary licensed version Java features include two new garbage collector implementations Flight Recorder to debug deep issues a new HTTP client including WebSocket support Java SE was released March In addition to language changes significant changes have been made to the Java class library over the years which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK to over three thousand in J SE Entire new APIs such as Swing and Java D have evolved and many of the original JDK classes and methods have been deprecated According to Oracle in the Java Runtime Environment was found on over million PCs Microsoft has not bundled a Java Runtime Environment JRE with its operating systems since Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft for adding Windows specific classes to the bundled Java runtime environment and for making the new classes available through Visual J citation needed Apple no longer includes a Java runtime with OS X as of version but the system prompts the user to download and install it the first time an application requiring the JRE is launched citation needed Many Linux distributions include the OpenJDK runtime as the default virtual machine negating the need to download the proprietary Oracle JRE Some Java applications are in fairly widespread desktop use including the NetBeans and Eclipse integrated development environments and file sharing clients such as LimeWire and Vuze Java is also used in the MATLAB mathematics programming environment both for rendering the user interface and as part of the core system Java provides cross platform user interface for some high end collaborative applications such as Lotus Notes Oracle plans to first deprecate the separately installable Java browser plugin from the Java Runtime Environment in JDK then remove it completely from a future release forcing web developers to use an alternative technology Java ME has become popular in mobile devices where it competes with Symbian BREW and the NET Compact Framework The diversity of mobile phone manufacturers has led to a need for new unified standards so programs can run on phones from different suppliers MIDP The first standard was MIDP which assumed a small screen size no access to audio and a KB program limit The more recent MIDP allows access to audio and up to KB for the program size With handset designs improving more rapidly than the standards some manufacturers relax some limitations in the standards for example maximum program size Google s Android operating system uses the Java language but not its class libraries therefore the Android platform cannot be called Java Android in all supported versions executes the code on the ART VM formerly the Dalvik VM up to Android instead of the Java VM The Java platform has become a mainstay of enterprise IT development since the introduction of the Enterprise Edition in in two different ways Enterprise use of Java has also long been the main driver of open source interest in the platform Open source communities have produced a large amount of software including simple function libraries development frameworks and open source implementations of standards and tools Duke is Java s mascot When Sun announced that Java SE and Java ME would be released under a free software license the GNU General Public License they released the Duke graphics under the free BSD license at the same time A new Duke personality is created every year For example in July Future Tech Duke included a bigger nose a jetpack and blue wings The source code for Sun s implementations of Java i e the de facto reference implementation has been available for some time but until recently when the license terms severely restricted what could be done with it without signing and generally paying for a contract with Sun As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform While several third party projects e g GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony created free software partial Java implementations the large size of the Sun libraries combined with the use of clean room methods meant that their implementations of the Java libraries the compiler and VM are comparatively small and well defined were incomplete and not fully compatible These implementations also tended to be far less optimized than Sun s citation needed Sun announced in JavaOne that Java would become free and open source software and on October at the Oracle OpenWorld conference Jonathan I Schwartz said that the company was set to announce the release of the core Java Platform as free and open source software within to days Sun released the Java HotSpot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the GNU General Public License on November with a promise that the rest of the JDK that includes the JRE would be placed under the GPL by March except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in distributable source form under the GPL According to Richard Stallman this would mean an end to the Java trap Mark Shuttleworth called the initial press announcement A real milestone for the free software community Sun released the source code of the Class library under GPL on May except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from third parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software and open source license Some of the encumbered parts turned out to be fairly key parts of the platform such as font rendering and D rasterising but these were released as open source later by Sun see OpenJDK Class library Sun s goal was to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source In the meantime a third party project called IcedTea created a completely free and highly usable JDK by replacing encumbered code with either stubs or code from GNU Classpath However OpenJDK has since become buildable without the encumbered parts from OpenJDK b and has become the default runtime environment for most Linux distributions In June it was announced that IcedTea as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora has passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java implementation Because OpenJDK is under the GPL it is possible to redistribute a custom version of the JRE directly with software applications rather than requiring the enduser or their sysadmin to download and install the correct version of the proprietary Oracle JRE onto each of their systems themselves In most cases Java support is unnecessary in Web browsers and security experts recommend that it not be run in a browser unless absolutely necessary It was suggested that if Java is required by a few Web sites users should have a separate browser installation specifically for those sites When generics were added to Java there was already a large framework of classes many of which were already deprecated so generics were chosen to be implemented using erasure to allow for migration compatibility and re use of these existing classes This limited the features that could be provided by this addition as compared to some other languages The addition of type wildcards made Java unsound Java lacks native unsigned integer types Unsigned data are often generated from programs written in C and the lack of these types prevents direct data interchange between C and Java Unsigned large numbers are also used in many numeric processing fields including cryptography which can make Java less convenient to use for these tasks Although it is possible to partially circumvent this problem with conversion code and using larger data types it makes using Java cumbersome for handling the unsigned data While a bit signed integer may be used to hold a bit unsigned value with relative ease a bit unsigned value would require a bit signed integer Additionally a bit unsigned value cannot be stored using any integer type in Java because no type larger than bits exists in the Java language If abstracted using functions function calls become necessary for many operations which are native to some other languages Alternatively it is possible to use Java s signed integers to emulate unsigned integers of the same size but this requires detailed knowledge of complex bitwise operations While Java s floating point arithmetic is largely based on IEEE Standard for Binary Floating Point Arithmetic certain features are not supported even when using the strictfp modifier such as Exception Flags and Directed Roundings capabilities mandated by IEEE Standard Additionally the extended precision floating point types permitted in and present in many processors are not permitted in Java In the early days of Java before the HotSpot VM was implemented in Java in there were some criticisms of performance However benchmarks typically report Java as being about slower than C a language which compiles to native code Java s performance has improved substantially since the early versions Performance of JIT compilers relative to native compilers has in some optimized tests been shown to be quite similar Java bytecode can either be interpreted at run time by a virtual machine or it can be compiled at load time or runtime into native code which runs directly on the computer s hardware Interpretation is slower than native execution and compilation at load time or runtime has an initial performance penalty for the compilation Modern performant JVM implementations all use the compilation approach so after the initial startup time the performance is equivalent to native code The Java platform provides a security architecture which is designed to allow the user to run untrusted bytecode in a sandboxed manner to protect against malicious or poorly written software This sandboxing feature is intended to protect the user by restricting access to certain platform features and APIs which could be exploited by malware such as accessing the local filesystem running arbitrary commands or accessing communication networks In recent years researchers have discovered numerous security flaws in some widely used Java implementations including Oracle s which allow untrusted code to bypass the sandboxing mechanism exposing users to malicious attacks These flaws affect only Java applications which execute arbitrary untrusted bytecode such as web browser plug ins that run Java applets downloaded from public websites Applications where the user trusts and has full control over all code that is being executed are unaffected On August Java and both supported back then on Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux were found to have a serious security flaw that allowed a remote exploit to take place by simply loading a malicious web page Java was later found to be flawed as well On January three computer specialists spoke out against Java telling Reuters that it was not secure and that people should disable Java Jaime Blasco Labs Manager with AlienVault Labs stated that Java is a mess It s not secure You have to disable it This vulnerability affects Java and it is unclear if it affects Java so it is suggested that consumers disable it Security alerts from Oracle announce schedules of critical security related patches to Java On January security experts said that the update still failed to protect PCs from attack This exploit hole prompted a response from the United States Department of Homeland Security encouraging users to disable or uninstall Java Apple blacklisted Java in limited order for all computers running its macOS operating system through a virus protection program Responding to recent Java security and vulnerability issues security blogger Brian Krebs has called for users to remove at least the Java browser plugin and also the entire software I look forward to a world without the Java plugin and to not having to remind readers about quarterly patch updates but it will probably be years before various versions of this plugin are mostly removed from end user systems worldwide Once promising it has outlived its usefulness in the browser and has become a nightmare that delights cyber criminals at the expense of computer users I think everyone should uninstall Java from all their PCs and Macs and then think carefully about whether they need to add it back If you are a typical home user you can probably do without it If you are a business user you may not have a choice The Java runtime environment has a history of bundling sponsored software

      "The use of bytecode as an intermediate language permits Java programs to run on any platform that has a virtual machine available. Google's Android operating system uses the Java language, but not its class libraries, therefore the Android platform cannot be called Java. Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing many of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems. By the summer of 1992, the team could demonstrate portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. For these reasons, it is more of a transitional language to switch from Java to the .NET platform than it is a first class .NET language. Open source communities have produced a large amount of software, including simple function libraries, development frameworks, and open source implementations of standards and tools. For example, the Java compiler, which converts Java source code into Java bytecode (an intermediate language for the JVM), is provided as part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).\n"
